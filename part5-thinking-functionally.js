// With that in mind, write functions that accomplish the following:
// Take an array of numbers and return the sum.
// Take an array of numbers and return the average.
// Take an array of strings and return the longest string.
// Take an array of strings, and a number and return an array of the strings that are longer than the given number. 
// For example, stringsLongerThan(['say', 'hello', 'in', 'the', 'morning'], 3); would return ["hello", "morning"].
// Take a number, n, and print every number between 1 and n without using loops. Use recursion.
